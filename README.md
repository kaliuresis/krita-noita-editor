# krita-noita-editor
This is a plugin for krita for creating custom static noita maps.

## Installation
Make sure you have krita 5.0 or higher for windows, which can be downloaded for free at https://binary-factory.kde.org/job/Krita_Stable_Windows_Build/. You can also buy it on the windows store, steam, or the epic store to support the developers and get automatic updates (I'm not sure how getting 5.0 works for these).

Open Krita and go to Tools ‣ Scripts ‣ Import Python Plugin from Web and enter `https://github.com/kaliuresis/krita-noita-editor` as the download URL.
Go to Configure Krita ‣ Python Plugins Manager, find the Noita Editor and enable it. Restart Krita.

A manual on the basic usage of the plugin can be found by going to Configure Krita ‣ Python Plugins Manager then clicking Noita Editor.
