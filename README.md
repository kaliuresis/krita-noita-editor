# krita-noita-editor
This is a plugin for krita for creating custom static Noita maps. The maps are exported as a mod, which can be shared like any other Noita mod.

## Installation
* Make sure you have krita 5.0 or higher for windows, which can be downloaded for free at https://binary-factory.kde.org/job/Krita_Stable_Windows_Build/. You can also buy it on the windows store, steam, or the epic store to support the developers and get automatic updates (I'm not sure how getting 5.0 works for these).

* Download https://github.com/kaliuresis/krita-noita-editor/releases/latest/download/noita_editor.zip
* Open Krita and go to Tools ‣ Scripts ‣ Import Python Plugin from File and select the zip file you just downloaded.
* Go to Configure Krita ‣ Python Plugins Manager, find the Noita Editor and enable it. Restart Krita.

## Usage
A manual on the basic usage of the plugin can be found by going to Configure Krita ‣ Python Plugins Manager then clicking Noita Editor.
More detailed tutorials are planned.
